## Capabilities

### Use
The web application's main function is that it takes in text-based file(s) and generates quizlets (questions and answers based on the input text).
Therefore the user is able to answer those questions by chosing with a click or tap from the given answers. The answers then reveal themselves (showing color coded responses by filling themselves).
The answer is green - the correct answer for the question.
The answer is red - the false answer for the question.

### General structural capabilities
The web application requires credentials for login status OR it can be used by Google Sign In method.
The application is mainly a one pager style, means that it is supposed to only maintain one Screen/Page and offer you operations on that.
Furhtermore, it supposed to render and update the content of the page, the elements by statement or other event changes - yes this is eventhandling.
Using React - it's meant to be reactive by any means. For examplar - the user experience on different devices supposed to remain the same - optimalized view on any device.
For the Question and Answer generation, the ChatGpt3.5-turbo is used, with implementation of the Firebase Extension feature.
