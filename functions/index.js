    `Exactly 3 Answer Choices: For each question, provide three answer options, ensuring they are clear, concise, and cover a range of possibilities.\n` +
    `Right Answer Marked with "*": Indicate the most accurate answer for each question by placing an asterisk (*) in front of it.\n` +

    `Document: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\n\n` +
